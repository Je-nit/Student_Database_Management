# Student_Database_Management
Develop a database-like CLI (Command Line Interface) application for student records. The application should support:

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a database-like CLI (Command Line Interface) application for student records. The application should support: Adding, deleting, displaying, and editing student records. Searching, sorting, and saving data. File handling to persist data between sessions.

## 🧑‍💻 User Interface
On execution (./dataBase), the program displays a menu with the following options:

MENU

a/A : Add a new student record

p/P : Print the records from database

s/S : Save the database in a file

d/D : Delete a record

e/E : Edit a record (shows a sub-menu)

For name edit
For DOB
For percentage
For contact
For email id
f/F : Find a student

r/R : Reverse the display of records (in-memory only)

q/Q : Quit the app

## 📌 Requirements
Record Structure: Each student record must include: Student ID (e.g., V24HE5A1) Name Date of Birth Percentages (Matriculation, Inter/Diploma, Graduation) Contact number Email ID Unique IDs: No duplicate student IDs allowed. File Persistence: Previously saved data should be reloaded when the app is restarted.

## 📦 Deliverables
Modular Code: Use user-defined functions (e.g., add_record(), find_record()).

Makefile: Include a makefile for compilation.

README: Explain usage, compilation, and execution.

Persistence: Ensure data is saved and restored between sessions.

Submission Format: A folder named with your ID containing:

Source code

Header files

Makefile

readme.txt

## 🔧 Project Implementation Guidelines
Version 1 Use structure pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

No file handling.

Version 2 Use structure pointers and Singly Linked List (SLL).

Include file handling for saving/loading data.

## 💡 Suggestions
Use typedef, enum, and union where applicable.

Create a separate header file to store all data structures and type definitions.
